/* can't come up with a solution yet 

  // let's imagine we are at step 1 and the top is step 10
  // if we only climb 1 step then total number of steps would be n - 1
  // if we only climb 2 steps and the top number is odd then the total number of steps would be n - 2/ 2

  // n is = or > 1 so there will always be atleast 1 way to reach the top
  // if n is odd number then there will always be 1 way to reach the top by n - 2/2 steps
  // if n is an even number then there will always be 1 way to reach the top by n steps
  //
